# Cubemars Python Tools

This repository contains Python tools and examples for interacting with Cubemars motors. It provides a Python API to communicate with the motors and includes demonstration scripts for various functionalities.

## Directory Structure

- `Cubemars-Python-API/`: This directory contains the core Python API for communicating with Cubemars motors. It provides the necessary classes and functions to control and read data from the motors.

## Example Scripts

- `multi_motor_keyboard_input.py`: An example script demonstrating how to control multiple Cubemars motors using keyboard input. This can be useful for testing motor responses and basic control.
- `set_motor_origin.py`: A utility script to set the origin (zero) position of a Cubemars motor. This is crucial for proper calibration and control of the motor's absolute position.

Further instructions on setting up the environment and running these scripts would typically be found within the `Cubemars-Python-API/` directory or within each script's docstrings.
